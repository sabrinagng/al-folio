Hey there! My name is Sabrina Geng. I am currently a senior (4th-year) undergraduate at UNC Chapel Hill, double-majoring in Computer Science and Statistics & Analytics. My research spans from NLP to Human-Computer Interaction focusing on human-centered AI from which personalized healthcare can foster. 

I began my undergraduate studies goal in media and journalism, but after taking a programming class at UNC, I got completely hooked on coding and made the big leap to Computer Science. I began my research with [Prof. Wubin Bai](https://baigroup.org/) at UNC Chapel Hill, where I developed interest and gained experience in human-centric AI and how wearble sensors benefit human society. I also work with [Prof. Prasun Dewan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/) and [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/), examining how AI can adapt to individual and group interaction patterns. Currently, I am working with [Prof. Momona Yamagami](https://momona.rice.edu/) at Rice University on simplifying the current EMG-based gesture classification pipeline with Self-Supervised Learning.

Beyond research and code reviews, youâ€™ll often find me at the piano, experimenting with new recipes, or losing myself in the world of filming wherever I can.
